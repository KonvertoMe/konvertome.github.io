  <h1>Konverto – Online File Conversion Tools</h1>

  <p>
    Konverto is an online platform focused on simple, fast, and accessible file conversion tools.
    It allows users to convert files directly in their web browser without installing any software
    or dealing with complex configurations.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project emphasizes ease of use, minimal friction, and practical tools designed for everyday
    productivity needs.
  </p>

  <h2>About the project</h2>

  <p>
    This GitHub Pages site presents documentation, experiments, and technical notes related to
    online file conversion and lightweight web-based productivity tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Konverto explores how modern web technologies can be used to deliver fast and reliable
    file processing experiences while keeping interfaces simple and intuitive.

  <h2>Core features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Online file conversion directly in the browser</li>
    <li>No software installation or setup required</li>
    <li>Fast processing for common file types</li>
    <li>Clean and minimal user interface</li>
    <li>Usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Supported use cases</h2>

  <p>
    Konverto tools are designed for a wide range of everyday scenarios, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Converting documents for school or university assignments</li>
    <li>Preparing files for professional or administrative use</li>
    <li>Quick file transformations without access to installed software</li>
    <li>Lightweight productivity tasks on shared or public devices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Supported file categories</h2>

  <p>
    While available tools may evolve over time, Konverto focuses on common and widely used
    file categories:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Documents (PDF, text, office formats)</li>
    <li>Images (basic image format conversions)</li>
    <li>Compressed files and lightweight media formats</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Privacy and security</h2>

  <p>
    Konverto aims to respect user privacy and minimize data retention.
    File processing is designed to be temporary and limited to what is strictly necessary
    to perform the requested conversion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Secure connections (HTTPS) are used to protect data during transfer, and no unnecessary
    personal information is required to use the tools.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical approach</h2>

  <p>
    The project experiments with modern web standards and browser-based technologies,
    focusing on performance, reliability, and accessibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whenever possible, lightweight and efficient solutions are preferred over complex
    or heavyweight architectures.
  </p>

  <h2>Project status and roadmap</h2>

  <p>
    Konverto is an evolving project.
    Features, tools, and supported formats may change as new experiments are tested
    and refined.
  </p>

  <p>
    Future improvements may include additional conversion tools, interface enhancements,
    and performance optimizations.
  </p>

  <h2>Contributions and feedback</h2>

  <p>
    Feedback, ideas, and discussions around web-based productivity tools are welcome.
    This project exists as part of ongoing exploration of open web technologies and
    practical online utilities.
